		LuxSoftware is a software development company that focuses on game development. We aim to create a game development process more stable than any other, while still providing features that are essential to the process.
	</p>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>We aim to create better game development process. There are many game SDKs and engines to chose from. Each one provides a set of features, but lacks features found in another. LuxSoftware is on a mission to eliminate this problem. First off, all of our software and libraries are cross-platform. Now, consider the Quake engine's features. This engine supports one type of map file, BSP. While this engine is popular and can be considered a legacy, it is still very limited. All of our software and libraries support their own file types, as well as the ability to import/export well known file types, ultimately making it easy to switch over to our software and libraries.</p>
