	<h1>LuxEngine</h1>
	<p>
		A vastly functional and professional 3D game development suite/engine.
	</p>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		There are so many game development kits and engines out on the market. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages. Some engines provide a vast amount of tools for your use in game development, while some only provide code for you to build off of, requiring you to use 3rd-party software to produce a more sophisticated result, but may actually be more stable. LuxEngine fixes this issue by providing developers multiple versions that can be acquired for development:
		<span class="list">
			<span class="list-item"><b>LuxEngine</b> - Engine code only. For developers who like to work from the bare-bones.</span>
			<span class="list-item"><b>LuxEngine Tools</b> - Engine code and essential tools. For developers who need assistance with code and/or resources.</span>
			<span class="list-item"><b>LuxEngine Suite</b> - Engine code and complete toolkit. For developers who are serious about game creation and require tools to assist them.</span>
